In each spreadsheet there is a tab for many subcategories. In each tab there are additional columns (one for  each of the CIS/ARK vendors) with unique IDs for each term, for each vendor (vendor-specific ID for each term).


#### Q&A


Q: Do you know what the status is of the vendors doing the mapping to these vendor-specific IDs?

A: The vendors doing the mapping would be Shoulders and their contract expires September 30th.  There will be a new terminology vendor supporting this effort.  These terms are pushed more frequently than quarterly (every month and a half).  The vendors of CIS and ARK COTS ( Philips, Draeger,  PICIS) only get 3 or 4 daysâ€™ notice to update the terminology from Shoulders.
