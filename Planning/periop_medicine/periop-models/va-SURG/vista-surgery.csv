The branches to the right atrium (sinus node artery) and right ventricle (conus branch and acute marginal branches) are commonly ignored when describing coronary artery disease. However, the right coronary artery is the most common source for the posterior descending coronary artery and often gives-off branches to the posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle.

The true circumflex lies in the groove separating the left atrium from the left ventricle (A-V groove) for a variable distance following its origination from the left main coronary artery. Typically, it gives-off one or more branches that leave the A-V groove to supply the posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle. These are known as marginal branches. A few patients have a branch to the posterior-lateral free wall of the left ventricle arising exactly at the bifurcation of the left main coronary artery into the left anterior descending coronary artery and the circumflex coronary artery.

In rare cases a ""contract"" facility may be a community hospital when there is no University affiliate for the VAMC. By contrast, a ""fee-basis"" patient surgery should not be indicated as a ""contract"" facility.

Numbers may be converted to describe the severity of the mitral regurgitation on the cardiac cath report to the adjectives describing the severity: 1+ = mild, 2 or 3+ = moderate, and 4+ = severe. Both transvalvular gradient and estimated valve orifice area are used to assess the severity of obstruction (stenosis) of a valve. The transvalvular pressure gradient is obtained by converting the velocity of blood flow across the valve measured by the Doppler principle to pressure drop using the Bernoulli equation. The pressure drop, which is dependent on flow, can be converted to estimated valve orifice area if flow is known. If the echo report uses an adjective to describe the severity of stenosis, indicate the corresponding adjective.

Report the corresponding level of self-care for activities of daily living demonstrated by this patient for the following two time points: (a) prior to the current illness, and (b) at the time the patient is being evaluated for surgery (which should be no longer than 30 days prior to surgery).

For each of these time points, report the level of functional health status as defined by the following criteria. (1) Independent: The patient does not require assistance from another person for any activities of daily living. This includes a person who is able to function independently with prosthetics, equipment, or devices.

The classification assigned by the clinician may vary if the patient is in the supine position (instead of sitting). If the patient phonates, this falsely improves the view. If the patient arches his or her tongue, the uvula is falsely obscured. A class I view suggests ease of intubation and correlates with a laryngoscopic view grade I 99 to 100% of the time.
