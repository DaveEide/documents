The Project understands that the GFE and GFI set forth in the PWS will be provided to the Team in a timely manner to ensure successfully completion of the Project. As presently stated in the PWS, within 30 days of contract award the Government will provide contractor access to:
  • Data Dictionary (DD) extracts from at least five current operational VISTA systems. These data dictionaries contain no patient data, PHI, or PII (i.e., no sensitive information).
  • Current authoritative Master ("Platinum") version of VISTA as maintained internally by the VA. Metadata from this must be complete and without any alterations or redactions. The metadata does not contain any patient data, PHI, or PII (i.e., no sensitive information).
  • Copy of a VISTA with test patients used by VA for internal projects.
  • Copy of at least one real operational VISTA ("Prod Clone" or “Test VISTA”) to be kept within the NIPR network, as it will have non de-identified patient data.
  • A VISTA with real but de-identified patient data.

In addition, the Team requests the additional GFE and GFI be provided within 30 days of contract award to successfully execute the Project:
  • A copy of the latest version of the VPR RPC software and documentation.
  • The latest copy of the FileMan namespace spreadsheet.
  • A FileMan namespace exclusively for the Team to allow for the creation of Project files and fields in FileMan.
  • Access to the most up-to-date VISTA Integrations Agreements (sometimes called IAs), or Database Administrator Integration Agreements (DBIAs).
  • Sufficient InterSystems Cache licenses to host FileMan Test VISTA systems.
  • VA VISTA Sandbox Account with full Linux VM.

In the absence of Government written disagreement as to the provision of the above stated GFE/GFI, the Team will understand that such GFE/GFI will be delivered within 30 days of contract award.
