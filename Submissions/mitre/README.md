### VISTA Data Project: Performance Metrics

__The VISTA Data Project features can only be measured relative to the existing architecture, not in a vacuum__.

### Security
What are the current security layers, features, issues, vulnerabilities?

System | Security Layers and Issues
--- | ---
VISTA/CPRS | 
MDWS | 
JLV | 
VPR | 
eHMP | 


### Read/Write
What are the current read/write capabilities 

System | Read/Write | Notes
---|---|---
VISTA /CPRS | read/write | 
MDWS | read-only | 
JLV | read-only | 
VPR | read-only | 
eHMP | read-only | 



### Transaction Processing
What are the current network latency for Reading any data to VISTA? Writing? Transaction processing? 

System |  Functionality | Latency / Throughput
---|---|---
VISTA /CPRS | READ/WRITE |   < 0.2 sec for all transactions <br> This is the gold standard
MDWS | READ | Restricted to a subset of CPRS RPCs
JLV | READ|  Restricted to a subset of CPRS and VPR RPCs
VPR | READ |  Restricted to the VPR RPCs
eHMP | READ |  ???
