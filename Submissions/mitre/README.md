MDWS | 
JLV | 
VPR | 
eHMP | 


### Read/Write
What are the current read/write capabilities

### Network Latency
What are the current network latency for reading data? writing data?

System |  Functionality | Latancy
---|---|---
VISTA /CPRS | read/write |   < 0.2 sec for all transactions <br> This is the gold standard
