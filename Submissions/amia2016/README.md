#### AMIA 2016 Program Themes
https://www.amia.org/amia2016/themes

* Data Science: Research and applications of data science in all areas of health and biomedicine, including visualization and exploration of large data sets, data mining, modeling and analytics approaches, technologies to scale to large datasets, and use of simulations to model complex healthcare and health phenomena.
* Data Interoperability and Health Information Exchange: Methods to develop and implement various clinical data integration and exchange activities, including use of standard data formats (e.g., continuity of care document or HL7, Clinical Document Architecture) and vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED, LOINC, ICD-9).
* Clinical Informatics: Findings related to the design, development, and implementation and maintenance of state-of-the-art clinical systems, including electronic health records, standards and interoperability, clinical decision support, and effects on clinical quality, safety, and patient outcomes.
* Clinical Research Informatics: Addressing the critical need for effective information management to address the many challenges facing clinical research and the rapid evolution of the biomedical informatics methods specifically designed to address clinical research information management.


#### Systems Demonstrations

Systems demonstrations are presented during program sessions, and most often illustrate one or more aspects of a leading edge system that is in use, under development, or at a testing or prototype stage. Each demonstration is 30 minutes long, with an additional 15 minutes for audience questions and comments. An individual may be a first author of only one proposal for a systems demonstration.

Your uploaded systems demonstration manuscript file must be submitted as a one page (8.5 x 11 inch) document and must include:

   - The names, academic degree(s), affiliations, and locations (city, state, and country, if international) of all presenters
    - An abstract of 150-200 words summarizing the proposal, which will also be entered into a text box at the beginning of the online form to be used in the online and print programs
    - A description of the specific purposes of the system, service, or project; the problems in health care practice, biomedicine, or research in informatics that it is designed to address; and the purpose or features of the system, service, or project that make it particularly innovative
    - A statement of the degree to which the system or service has been deployed, as of the date of submitting the proposal
