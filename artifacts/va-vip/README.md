## VA Software Development Project Management 

VA recently moved from PMAS to Veteran-focused Integration Process (VIP) to reduce the documentation and reporting burden on VA contracted development. This proposal is outlined [here](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/blob/master/artifacts/va-vip/VIP_Intro_2015-01-18.md). The original slide deck is 
[here](https://github.com/vistadataproject/documents/blob/master/artifacts/va-vip/VIP_Intro_2015-01-18.pdf) or


Note that VIP's technical strategy for software development involves Sharepoint and IBM Clearcase.  Sharepoint is a VA-specific special repository for artifacts and documents.  IBM's Clearcase is a proprietary software management system.  Both of these 'technical solutions' preclude any form of real-time collaboration with developers.

Clearcase was new and cool in 1992.  Nearly 25 years later it is not.  Today virtually all large software development and management organizations  (Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Linkedin,  Microsoft, etc.)  are using Github for all these code and managment functions to maximize agility and real-time development collaboration with a worldwide network of developers.    It is time for VA to modernize, starting with getting on board with the Github.
