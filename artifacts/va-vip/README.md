## VA Software Development Project Management 

VA recently moved from PMAS to VIP to allow software development to reduce the documentation and reporting burden on the development team. For a web readable version of the proposal, see:

Note that VIP's  "technical strategy" for project management involves Sharepoint and IBM Clearcase.  Sharepoint is a VA-firewalled special repository, making it impossible to collaborate with external development partners. IBM's Clearcase was new in 1992. 

Today all large software development and management organizations  (Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Linkedin,  Microsoft, etc.)  are using Github for all these functions to maximize agility and real-time development collaboration with a worldwide network of developers. Therefore one must examine a modernization and migration strategy to Github.
