The ADT module functions as the focal collection point of patient information, encompassing demographic, employment, insurance, and medical history data. Many other modules, such as Laboratory, Pharmacy, Radiology, Nursing, and Dietetics, utilize information gathered through the various ADT options. Several features have been designed to maximize efficiency and maintain control over user access of specified sensitive patient records. The Patient Sensitivity function allows a level of security to be assigned to certain records within the database (i.e., records of employees, government officials, etc.) in order to maintain control over unauthorized user access. The Patient Lookup function screens user access of these records. It also provides for efficient and faster retrieval of patient records and identified potential duplicate patient entries. The ADT module allows for efficient and accurate collection, maintenance, and output of patient data, thus enhancing a health care facility’s ability to provide quality care to its patients. The functions within ADT currently fall into five major categories: Application Processing (registration), Bed Control (inpatient movements), Inpatient Care Grouping (DRG), Data Transmission to National Database (PTF), Supervisor Functions (system setup and maintenance), and Local/National Management Reporting.</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:302.71pt; " class="ce2"><p>OIT PD</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:258.09pt; " class="ce1"><p>Business Informatics</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:47.51pt; " class="Default"> </td></tr><tr class="ro6"><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce1"><p>Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE)</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:394.81pt; " class="ce2"><p>VHA</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:76.39pt; " class="ce1"><p>DVBA</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:99.89pt; " class="ce1"><p>2.7</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​The Automated Medical Information Exchange (AMIE) module facilitates the electronic interchange of veteran information between Veteran Benefits Administration (VBA) Regional Offices (ROs) and VA medical facilities.</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>N/A</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>N/A</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Provides access to local databases for identification of a veteran’s admission, discharge, outpatient treatment, patient care, and other information that may require adjudicative actions.Reduces overpayments previously caused by lost, misrouted, or improperly processed admission notificationsProvides on-line status determinations of pending compensation and pension examinations (requesting, scheduling, tracking, and updating results)Provides RO on-line access to the local databases for the confirmation of the propriety of payments based on hospitalization.Improves timeliness of the RO benefits adjustment processing.Allows medical centers to electronically access sections of the Physicians Guide for Disability Evaluation Examinations.Provides tracking of insufficiently completed compensation and pension examinations.</p><p> </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​This comprehensive module provides an accurate audit trail to track most requests for information.

It offers VHA Compensation &amp; Pension (C&amp;P) staff an easy, standardized way of reporting C&amp;P Examination results.</p><p>Using CAPRI, VBA employees have a standardized, user-friendly method to rapidly access veterans' electronic medical records throughout the VA. Initially developed specifically for VBA, the utility of CAPRI has been expanded to other user groups that include VHA, Office of the Medical Inspector, OI, Research, Veteran Service Officers, and others. One of the primary features of CAPRI is the Compensation and Pension Worksheet Module (CPWM) which is used by VHA C&amp;P providers and staff. CPWM provides clinical users access to exam templates and tools that are used to document C&amp;P examinations.</p><p> </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:302.71pt; " class="ce2"><p>OIT PD </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:258.09pt; " class="ce1"><p>Business Informatics</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:47.51pt; " class="Default"> </td></tr><tr class="ro7"><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce1"><p>CPRS: Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART)</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:394.81pt; " class="ce2"><p>VHA Pharmacy Benefits Management (PBM)</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:76.39pt; " class="ce1"><p>GMRA</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:99.89pt; " class="ce1"><p>4.0</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​The Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) program provides a common and consistent data structure for adverse reaction data.

It is the goal of PSIM to provide an authoritative source for persons’ identity traits throughout the Veterans Health Administration (VHA).The review/verification phase of the patient merge process consists of two levels of review before verification. The primary reviewer performs a review of patient demographic information and determines if the pair is a duplicate record, then selects the record that will be merged into the other record, which is known as the merge direction. When data from ancillary services is present, a notification (via Mailman message or alert – or both) is sent to the designated ancillary reviewers. All reviewers determine whether the record pair is a duplicate, not a duplicate, or unable to determine the status. If all reviewers conclude that the pairs are duplicates and need to be merged, the record pair is designated as a verified duplicate available for merge approval. For those pairs determined not to be duplicates, the processing stops and the status indicates they are verified as non-duplicates. If status cannot be determined, the record pair remains in the DUPLICATE RECORD file and processing ends.The next phase is the merge of the record pairs. A wait time may be configured between verification and merge. The merge is a non-reversible process. Once the pair of records is merged, there is no automated way of undoing the process. The application has been written to support multiple parallel jobs (threads - as specified by the site) during the merge process, and multiple pairs can be merged in a single process. However, only one merge process should be running at once.Although the software was designed with potential to merge New Person records, this capability is not included in the released version.</p><p> </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​The overall process is broken down into these phases:  duplicate patient records are identified by the VAMC staff or by a separate system interfaced with the Master Patient Index; VAMC staff review/verify the pairs and approve the pairs; and VAMC IT or expert users schedule and monitor merges of the record pairs.</p><p> </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:302.71pt; " class="ce2"><p>OIT PD</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:258.09pt; " class="ce1"><p>Common Services</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:47.51pt; " class="Default"> </td></tr><tr class="ro5"><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce1"><p>Electronic Error and Enhancement Reporting (E3R)</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:394.81pt; " class="ce2"><p>VHA</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:76.39pt; " class="ce1"> </td><td style="text-align:left;width:99.89pt; " class="ce1"><p>1.0</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​Electronic Error and Enhancement Reporting (E3R) package is designed for storing, reporting, and tracking the requests for changes in VistA applications.</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Monitor Clinical Performance, Utilize Information Technology Services</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Provide Health Care Administration, Manage Business Enabling Services</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Tracking, storing, reporting requests for changes in VistA</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Anyone in VHA may propose an enhancement using E3R.

The proposal, along with all of the feedback from the mail group, is sent to the package's development program director for a final decision. E3R tracks and logs the entire discussion process on these enhancement proposals. Provides for submitter to initiate, modify, view or cancel a request. Assigns a suspense date and a status category to all submitted E3Rs. The status category informs all users of the request's current state in the processing cycle. Generates a mail message containing the text of the request whenever an E3R is generated. The message is sent to the submitter, the package developer and members of the mail group associated with the package. Tracks package developer's response to each E3R request. Developer can deny or accept the request, enter comments on it, and refer a request to an arbitrator if he feels the request should not be assigned to a package. Permits an arbitrator to enter comments, to reassign the request to the appropriate package, and, along with the package developer, to accept or deny the request.

Rossio Report) dated December 15, 2000. In the area of Means Test (MT) Deficiencies, Item #22 required that the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) identify best practices for means testing and acquiring veterans’ signatures at the local level and explore the promulgation of these best practices throughout the system. Until Patch EAS*1*3 was released in April 2002, there were no provisions within Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) functionality that prevented the scheduling of future appointments for patients who required a MT. Additionally, there was no mechanism present to provide the patient adequate notification of the need to provide a current MT prior to the annual anniversary date. In response to the Rossio Report, the Enrollment Task Force recommended the national implementation of functionality similar to that developed locally at several sites in order to manage scheduling activities for veterans who require the completion of a MT. Sites that had developed and implemented local software (Class III) provided copies of their routines and supporting documentation to the Enrollment Systems Group (ESG) to assist in this endeavor. Patch EAS*1*3 (April 2002) provided a national patch release to the Enrollment Application Systems (EAS) software of locally implemented software that had been converted from Class III to Class I.  Patch EAS*1*15 is in response to requests for enhancements and changes to the way MT reminder letters are printed and to correct issues with letter printing as reported by several sites.​</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:302.71pt; " class="ce2"><p>OIT PD</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:258.09pt; " class="ce1"><p>Business Informatics</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:47.51pt; " class="Default"> </td></tr><tr class="ro4"><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce1"><p>Enrollment Application System: Long Term Care (LTC) Copayment</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:394.81pt; " class="ce2"><p>VHA CBO</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:76.39pt; " class="ce1"><p>EAS</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:99.89pt; " class="ce1"><p>1.0</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>This module supports the mandate for collection of Long Term Care copayments, as required by Public Law 106-117.</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Provide Member Access</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>Provide Access to Health Care </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​Allows users to enter, edit, store and print financial information given by the veteran on VA Form 10-10EC, Application for Extended Care Services.Allows users to designate a veteran who is exempt from the LTC copayments and the reason for the exemptionUsing the financial information entered from the VA Form 10-10EC, Application for Extended Care Services, automatically calculates and displays or prints an estimate of the LTC copayments that the veteran will be obligated to pay for the next twelve monthsProvides Integrated Billing with a veteran's copayment amount via an APIAutomates eligibility exemptionsAdds the LTC Copayment Exemption Test submenu and associated user optionsProvides spend-down calculations.Allows users who have the appropriate security key to delete a LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC)Allows users who have the appropriate security key to edit the date of a LTC Copayment TestAllows users to add a new LTC Copayment Test for the veteran at any time, including multiple tests within the same yearAllows users to enter burial and funeral expenses for single veteransAllows users to enter expenses greater than total income on the input screen for the LTC Copayment Test (10-10EC)Displays the veteran’s LTC copayment status and last test date when using the following Registration user options: Load/Edit, Patient Inquiry, and Register a PatienIf the veteran did not agree to pay the copayments display a message that indicates that the veteran is ineligible for LTC servicesPrevents the entry of a LTC Copayment Test for a patient who is not a veteran.Corrects the display of the DECLINES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL INFORMATION field to include both the “YES” and “NO” responses when the LTC Copayment Test is displayedModifies the Calculated LTC Copayments report to correctly display the maximum copayment amounts for veterans who refuse to pay the copaymentCorrects the determination of the LTC Copayment status when a veteran’s income is $0.

MVI data is maintained in a centralized, dynamic database that is available to meet multiple information needs across many applications and systems. The MVI central database, located at VA Austin Information Technology Center, is composed of a unique list of patients and a current list of systems to which each patient entry is correlated. This enables the sharing of patient data between operationally diverse systems. Each record (or index entry) in the MVI contains a small amount of identity/demographic data used to identify individual entries. It is primarily used by VistA applications requiring the need to enumerate unique patients at their facilities.</p><p> </p><p>The MVI assigns each patient (1) a unique patient identifier (Integration Control Number, or ICN) and</p><p>(2) initially assigns the requesting site as the Coordinating Master Of Record (CMOR), which represents the system that is presently the authoritative source for the patient's identity data. Each index entry in the MVI also contains the patient's identifying information (e.g., name, SSN, date of birth, gender) and a current list of facilities where the patient has been seen. The MVI is updated as new patients are added or demographic information is updated at the correlated system.

Each Tab provides an “alert” light, which turns green only when the patient has active medication orders for that Tab. Patient safety tools include a Missed Medications Report, an alert when due medications are not administered, a notification when a patient is transferred, and an alert light to indicate that a medication order exists for the Schedule Type and Start/Stop Date and Time selected on the VDL. Other tools include a listing of Allergies and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) that are documented for a patient in the Allergy/Adverse Reaction Tracking (ART) package. A Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) Med Order Button (or “Hot Button”) on the BCMA Tool Bar streamlines the workflow in ICU-type environments. This button links nurses directly to CPRS for electronically ordering, documenting, reviewing and signing verbal and telephone STAT and NOW (One-Time) medication orders already administered to patients. BCMA increases the amount and type of information available to nurses at the point of care, improves communications between Nursing and Pharmacy staff, records Missing Doses for patients, sends an electronic Missing Dose Request to the Pharmacy, and supports Health Level Seven (HL7) messaging. Management and accountability tools identify PRN entries that require effectiveness comments and pain scores, list medications that were not scanned as administered during an administration time window, list early/late administration variances, and allow nurses to set site-specific parameters and defaults on their systems. Compiles reports by Patient or by Ward for Nursing, Pharmacy, and Information Resources Management (IRM).

Veterans can call 1-800-273-TALK (8255) and press “1” to reach the VA hotline, which is staffed by mental health professionals 24/7/365 in Canandaigua, N.Y. who work closely with the callers’ local VA Suicide Prevention Coordinators and mental health providers to help the callers.</p><p>Legislation has been passed requiring VHA to take specific actions in the effort to prevent Veteran suicides. </p><p>“On November 6, 2007, President Bush signed into law the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act.  It’s named after a soldier who committed suicide in Grundy County, Iowa, in December 2005, after serving an 11-month tour in Iraq.  The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to meet deadlines in providing the following services:Train VA staff on suicide prevention and mental health careStaff each VA medical facility with a suicide prevention counselorScreen soldiers who seek care through the VA for mental health needsSupport outreach and education for veterans and their familiesResearch the most effective strategies for suicide preventionCreate a peer support counseling program so veterans can help other veteransHowever, while the bill requires the VA to provide these services, it provides no funding.</p><p>On February 6, 2008, Representative Leonard Boswell (D-IA) and Representative Robin Hayes (R-NC) introduced the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act (H.R. 5223).  This bill is focused on Department of Defense implementing a comprehensive suicide prevention program within all branches in the military, including National Guard and the Reserves.  The Air Force implemented a suicide prevention program in the 1990’s.  By 2002, the suicide rate had declined by 33% and researchers found a decrease in violent crime and family violence after program implementation.  This bill is designed to help the VA and Department of Defense deal with the increase in mental health needs of Iraq and Afghanistan service personnel.</p><p>Both VA Central Office and Congress want periodic reports relating to Veteran suicide and suicide prevention efforts.  Tracking cases may also allow for best practice identification. The Suicide Prevention Hotline Web Application went live, nationwide, on 6/9/2009 and the first update was put into production on 11/22/2010.</p><p> </p><p>Description of Current VCL Application: The VCL application provides an electronic version of the call log via a web-based application. VCL also stores information from hotline calls, which provides the ability to retrieve and view call information as needed.</p><p> </p><p>The VCL application has three components:Log Application used at the VA Suicide Prevention Hotline by Health Services Specialist (HSS) to log callsResponse Application used at VA facilities by Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs) to document referrals and save them in the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) as Progress NotesAdmin Component which is nested with the Health Techs (HT) application.  This component is used by hotline administrators and Social Services Assistants (SSA) to audit and administer the system. In the Admin view, the Log Application stores call information that can later be used for data collection and reporting purposes.In the Admin view, the Log Application provides a mechanism for hotline staff to view Veteran demographic information.  The application also provides the risk assessment module and the ability to identify the VA Medical Center (VAMC) closest to the caller’s physical location.In the admin view, the Log Application provides a means to refer a caller to a VAMC for follow-up care.  The referral is directed to the VA Medical Center’s SPC in real time. The SPC Response Application allows the ability to document the hotline referral in CPRS in the form of a Text Integration Utility (TIU) Progress Note.The SPC Response Application ensures all progress notes have a common note title.The SPC Application is automatically updated when a SPC completes the referral process.</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:302.71pt; " class="ce2"><p>Joe McDowell</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:258.09pt; " class="ce1"><p>Health Provider Systems </p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:47.51pt; " class="Default"> </td></tr><tr class="ro15"><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce1"><p>VA FileMan</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:394.81pt; " class="ce2"><p>VHA</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:76.39pt; " class="ce1"><p>DI</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:99.89pt; " class="ce1"><p>22.0</p></td><td style="text-align:left;width:457.51pt; " class="ce2"><p>​VA FileMan is the VistA database management system (DBMS).
