# Introduction to The VistA Monograph 	

This Monograph provides an overview of the VETERANS HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE information system—VistA—used by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in serving America’s veterans through the provision of quality health care which enhances our Veterans’ health and well-being.

VistA Development Historical Overview
As Health Information Technology (HIT) adoption —particularly the implementation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) by providers and health systems—increases across America, VHA can proudly and rightfully claim to have pioneered many aspects of the enterprise-wide HIT/EHR discipline. VistA’s patient-centric focus embodies the clinical workflow processes that support VA’s models of care, and VistA has enabled measurable improvements in health outcomes.

VistA had its origins in the collaboration of VA clinicians and HIT staff who capitalized on 1970’s and 1980’s emerging technology capabilities and created a better-informed way to serve Veterans and the Public’s Health. Groups of clinical and IT specialists deployed locally- developed computer applications to enhance patient care. Though developed in a geographically and organizationally diverse fashion, these applications were based in the MUMPS computer language. (MUMPS is an acronym for the Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System; the language, also known as M, remains prevalent in the health care arena and is the backbone of VistA and other well-known EHRs.) This decision to rely on MUMPS made it possible for these local development teams—often euphemistically known as “the Hard Hats”—to integrate these diverse applications, leading in 1982 to the forerunner to VistA, the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP.) DHCP evolved into VistA commencing in 1996; a key element of this evolution was the development and deployment of the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)—a graphical user interface (GUI) that interacts with the VistA kernel of common functions and integrated applications via reusable interfaces—which has been widely recognized as a premier, tightly-integrated Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) system, reflecting the direct role of clinicians in the development of VistA and its order management system.

As of this writing, the recently announced “VistA Evolution” portends the migration of VistA into an ever-more-capable HIT and EHR system for use not only “Intra-VHA” but with robust capabilities enhancing use “Inter-VHA,” most notably with the Department of Defense in the
advent of interoperable Electronic Health Record (iEHR) activities between the two Departments.

Why a VistA Monograph?
Owing to the myriad capabilities of VistA, and its ongoing evolution, VA deems it important to present and maintain the VistA Monograph. Collaboratively reviewed by numerous program offices and subject matter experts across VA, the Monograph is jointly maintained by the VA Office of Information Technology’s Product Development office, and VHA’s Office of Information and Analytics.

The purpose of the Monograph is to present a succinct and user-friendly overview of VHA’s VistA—most notably of the approximately 200 modules and applications comprising VistA—in general purpose language that provides basic information on the capabilities of each module. The Monograph, commencing with this version, also provides additional resources for readers interested in acquiring additional technical information on VistA, and identifies which offices within VA and VHA bear responsibility for maintaining VistA Monograph application/module descriptions moving forward.




# What is different in this version of the VistA Monograph?

## This version of the Monograph:
Introduces a new template format intended to enhance the appearance of and information within each VistA module’s description in the document.
Provides in each VistA module’s description (where applicable) identification of the
relevant VHA Business Function Framework (BFF) “Line of Business” and “Function” allowing “line of sight” linkage between the respective modules and the BFF. Complete information on the BFF is available at http://vaww.esm.infoshare.va.gov/sites/ba/default.aspx
Provides new table of content and index presentations, allowing for locating
modules either alphabetically or by IT portfolio grouping (as was used in pre-2013 versions of the document) or primary functional area.
Identifies for each VistA module the responsible business owner office, VHA Health
Systems Informatics or Strategic Investment Management Portfolio, and VA OIT Product Development section.
Includes external resource listing and depicts information sources used in the
preparation of the document.
Removes references to “HealtheVet VistA:” the series of envisioned VistA enhancements collectively referred to in previous editions of the Monograph as HealtheVet-VistA will be subsumed as appropriate under the “VistA Evolution” described above. (NOTE: Readers are encouraged to carefully differentiate “HealtheVet-VistA from the Veteran-facing array of products and services called “My HealtheVet”—a series of increasing, and increasingly vital, products and services relied upon heavily by VHA—and by the Veterans VHA serves, and their caregivers.

### Planned for future versions of the Monograph:
Screen shots for selected modules.
Transition of the Monograph to a “live” searchable online presence, evolving from the current state “static” posting of a pdf of the document on a web site.
Inclusion of additional technical information for selected modules, presented as appendices.
Schedules for when and how future Monograph updates will occur.
Listings of emerging VistA applications.
Listings of other widely-used/critical applications that are NOT VistA modules per se but whose importance merits mention in this “service catalog.”
Descriptions of “VistA Core” particularly as it relates to the iEHR.
Descriptions of the “Open Source” or “Platinum VistA” builds.
Details on VistA Evolution.
Further enhancements to the Module template.




## What is in the VistA Monograph…and what’s not?
WHAT’S IN? Thousands of programming components and millions of lines of computer code constitute VistA’s approximately 200 modules. The Monograph provides information on those modules.

VA describes as “Class 1” software those items that are nationally supported by VA OIT and deployed enterprise-wide across all of VHAs Medical Centers (VAMC) and Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOC). It is these enterprise-wide modules comprising VistA and deployed across the entire spectrum of VAMC and CBOC that are detailed in the Monograph.

WHAT’S NOT IN? There are many other software applications, some commercially-procured, some developed on either a regional level or VAMC/local level (known as “Class 2” and “Class  3” software) that are not nationally deployed and supported—and these items do not appear in
this version of the Monograph. Future editions of the Monograph will contain an appendix listing these important—but not VistA, by definition—applications and programs.






## Where can I find the VistA Monograph?
The current edition of the VistA Monograph is available at the following VA website:

## How do I recommend changes to or ask questions about the VistA Monograph?
The Monograph is maintained jointly by VHA’s Office of Informatics and Analytics and by VA’s
Office of Information Technology. Comments and suggestions for changes to the Monograph are welcomed, and should be forwarded via email to the OIT PD Product Support Monograph mailgroup.
