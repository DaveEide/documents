# WHAT IS VistA?

The VETERANS HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY ARCHITECTURE information
system—VistA—is a Health Information Technology (HIT) system created and used by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in serving America’s Veterans through the provision of exceptional-quality health care which enhances our Veterans’ health and well- being.


### VistA Brief Technical Overview
VistA is an integrated Electronic Health Record (EHR) information technology system with application packages that share a common data store and common internal services. The data store and VistA kernel are implemented in the MUMPS (or M) computer language, and the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented in Delphi.  Application clients use a highly-efficient proprietary protocol to access data. VistA is highly configurable and customizable, and in addition to appropriate connectivity amongst  VistA modules, VistA supports the integration of best-of-breed applications at multiple levels, including MUMPS API (Application Programming Interface,) Remote Procedure Call (RPC), Medical Domain Web Services (MDWS), HL7 (Health Level 7,) and data exchange via Blue  Button or eHealth Exchanges. VistA comprises nearly 200 distinct applications/modules, 15,000 routines, and millions of lines of computer code.

The backbone of VHA’s clinical and administrative information technology capability, VistA has historically been built on a client-server architecture, which ties together workstations and personal computers with graphical user interfaces at VA facilities. The CPRS GUI is as well  highly customizable and runs on workstations, laptops, tablets including iPads, and smart phones. VistA interoperates with numerous commercial-off-the shelf software applications and with selected information technology systems of other federal agencies and, increasingly,  health information exchange networks. At the time of publication of this edition of the Monograph, comprehensive proposed enhancements to VistA were in the initial stages; referred to as “VistA Evolution” these enhancements are will reflect development and architecture enhancements to allow greater interaction with data and greater efficiency for the VistA system.

Additional detailed technical information on VistA which exceeds the scope of this Monograph, is available at the VistA Documentation Library website.
Where is VistA used within VHA?
VistA is deployed universally across VHA at more than 1,500 sites of care, including each Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) and Community Living Center (CLC), as well as at nearly 300 VA Vet Centers.


#### How do I request changes to VistA?
VA staff members wishing to propose enhancements to VistA have several options—most notable among these being the submission of a “New Service Request” through the Innovation and Development Request Portal (IDRP).  


#### I am not in VHA…may I obtain VistA for my use?
VistA is available through several forums for interested parties not part of or affiliated with VA/VHA. VistA software applications are releasable through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Under FOIA, certain records may be withheld in whole or in part from the requestor if they fall within certain FOIA exemptions. Two of these exemptions form the basis for withholding software by the VA:
Protects certain records related solely to VA’s internal rules and practices.
Protects trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information.
Also removed are any copyrighted dynamic link library (dll), mental health tests, CPT codes, and electronic signature hashing algorithms. (These are detailed in a Readme.txt file on the CDs.) 

Requests for agency records or additional information via FOIA should be directed to:
Department of Veterans Affairs
FOIA Services (10P2C1) 810 Vermont Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20420
Electronic requests can be sent to VACOFOIASERVICE@VA.GOV



VA is committed to the Open Source community and was instrumental in the establishment of the Open Source Electronic Health Record Agent (OSEHRA.)  As part of the Department’s pioneering activities in the OSEHRA community, VA has contributed VistA code to the OSEHRA effort. 

VistA is a comprehensive, full-featured Health Information System and Electronic Health Record. The software must be properly configured to each healthcare setting by individuals knowledgeable about the software before the system is used to support healthcare delivery. VistA does not self-install.
